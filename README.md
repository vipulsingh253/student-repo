# Student Registration System

A simple, browser-based student registration system built with "html", "CSS", and "JavaScript".  
It supports adding, editing, deleting, and searching student records, with data persistence with the help of "LocalStorage".



##  Features

- **Add Students** – Store student name, ID, email, and contact number
- **Edit Existing Records** – Update any student’s details
- **Delete Records** – Remove students from the system
- **Search Students** – Filter by name, ID, or email
- **Validation** – Ensures  correctness of data with helpful error messages
- **Persistent Data** – Uses `localStorage` to keep records even after page reload
